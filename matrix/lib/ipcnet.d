/**
In addition to the above, the keyword void represents having no type. The
keywords cent and ucent are reserved for future use to represent signed and
unsigned 128 bit values.
Unless there is a specific reason not to, you can use int to represent whole
values. To represent concepts that can have fractional values, consider double.
The following are the terms that appeared in the table:
8Fundamental Types
∙ Boolean: The type of logical expressions, having the value true for truth and
false for falsity.
∙ Signed type: A type that can have negative and positive values. For example,
byte can have values from -128 to 127. The names of these types come from
the negative sign.
∙ Unsigned type: A type that can have only positive values. For example, ubyte
can have values from 0 to 255. The u at the beginning of the name of these
types comes from unsigned.
∙ Floating point: The type that can represent values with fractions as in 1.25.
The precision of floating point calculations are directly related to the bit count
of the type: higher the bit count, more precise the results are. Only floating
point types can represent fractions; integer types like int can only represent
whole values like 1 and 2.
∙ Complex number type: The type that can represent the complex numbers of
mathematics.
∙ Imaginary number type: The type that represents only the imaginary part of
complex numbers. The i that appears in the Initial Value column is the square
root of -1 in mathematics.
∙ nan: Short for "not a number", representing invalid floating point value.
